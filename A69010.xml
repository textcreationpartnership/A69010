         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, as the writings of God doe teſtifie that Antichriſt ſhall be conſumed by a breath: ſo the writings of men do alſo teſtifie, that the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall be weakned by rags. The breath which ſhall conſume him, is the preaching of the Goſpell: the rags which ſhall weaken him are printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. If he be burned by the one, bleſſe God for good preachers, if decaied by the other, thanke painfull writers. That theſe two are the meanes which muſt ruinate Antichriſt, we may ſee by the practiſe of our Antichriſtian aduerſaries. For though they haue many who declame againſt vs, yet will they ſuffer none to preach Ieſus Chriſt: and though they haue many to write againſt vs,<note place="margin">Read the inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of preaching and Printing, by Queene Mary in the booke of martyrs</note> yet few will they ſuffer to read their owne controuerſies. That they want Chriſt preached, behold their miſerie: that we haue him preached, ſee our felicitie: that their people dare not reade bookes, marke the tyrannie of the pope: that we haue libertie to read ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie worthie bookes, note the goodnes of God, and care of our gouernors. To this end authoritie permits manie excellent bookes daily to be publiſhed: and though much reading be a wearineſſe to the fleſh, and manie bookes bring confuſion to ſtudents, yet as the ſtomacke muſt be preſerued by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of meates, ſo the minde muſt bee cheriſhed with varietie of writers. That thou mayest be moued to read old diuinitie in a new faſhion I haue publiſhed in Engliſh this excellent diſcourſe: which, becauſe it is the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of the beſt writers of our age, I doubt not but it wil be welcom vnto thee. If thou lookeſt for order, few bookes more methodicall: if for matter few more Iudiciall, if for breuitie few more compendious, if for plainnes few more perſpicuous, if for vſe few more pretious. And if either emulation amongſt Stationers hinder not the ſale, as it doth the ſale of many excellent bookes, or the delite of vaine bookes do not hinder thee from reading it, as it doth many from the beſt things, I doubt not but thou ſhalt haue cauſe to ſay of this worthie man, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith of a worthie woman, many Doctors haue done learnedly, but thou ſurmounteſt them all. Buy this truth but ſell it not: read this booke, but forget it not. Thou ſhall buy much for little coſt, and read much to thy great gaine. Thus I commend thee to the grace of God, and my ſelfe to the grace of thy prayers.</p>

And therefore the eſſentiall properties which be in them are one in number and of one nature. Now a Perſon is the ſubſiſting in the diuine nature or the nature of God, which hauing relation to others, is diſtinguiſhed by ſome incommunicable proprietie: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Perſons are onely diſtinguiſhed and not ſeuered: as three men are indeed ſundred, though they be but one in kind.

As Theodoret ſaith: <hi>Thoſe things which be common to the perſon, are made proper to the natures by reaſon of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentitie of the perſon:</hi> (as Damaſcene ſaith) <hi>and the affinitie of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures one towards another, and becauſe there is but one perſon,</hi> Orthod. fid. lib. 3. cap. 3. &amp; 4. Or elſe it is ſuch a manner of predication whereby thoſe things which be proper to the natures are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently attributed to the perſon of Chriſt which is but one: and that becauſe Chriſt in his two natures is both, to wit, perfect God and perfect man, to whom therefore thoſe things are truly and indeed attributed as well which are proper to God, as thoſe which be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to man.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is well and truly ſaid: God, or elſe the Son of God was borne of the Virgin Marie, ſuffered, was crucified: and God purchaſed vnto himſelfe the Church with his owne bloud. 1. Cor. 2.8. Act. 20.28. Not ſimply, principally, and by himſelfe, as he is God, but by accident, and in another reſpect, or in regard of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: becauſe that which is proper to one nature, namely, to be conceiued, borne, crucified, to die, is not attributed to his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but to the perſon taking the name of one, namely, the diuine nature. For this word the Sonne of God, or God (which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the propoſition) is the Concrete and not the Abſtract, and ſignifieth not the diuine nature, but the perſon, who is God and man.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is well ſaid: The Sonne of man or Chriſt man, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, almightie, al-preſent; ſaueth, raiſeth the dead, giueth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. And Ioh. 31.13. <hi>No man aſcendeth into heauen, but he that commeth downe from heauen:</hi> both in reſpect of the vnion, ſeeing that the ſelfe ſame perſon is both man and God: for as God by reaſon of the vnitie doth account thoſe things which belong to the humane nature proper to himſelfe, ſaith Cyril of the incarnation of the onely begotten, cap. 26: ſo as he is man by reaſon of the vnion, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe things which belong to the diuine nature to be proper to it ſelfe: and alſo becauſe the Sonne of man is a word Concrete, which ſignifieth the perſon of Chriſt, being but one, conſiſting of the diuine and humane nature: and therefore whole Chriſt is euery where preſent, but not all that is in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Of certaine Anabaptiſts who reiected the booke of Iob as a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned tragicall Comedie; yea the Song of ſongs, and Eccleſiaſtes, as if the one taught Epicuriſme, the other were a wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue Ballad. Yet for Iob we haue his countrie and condition ſet downe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of his booke, which argueth no fiction: and beſides, he is mentioned by Ezechiel, cap. 14.14. and Iam. cap. 5.11. and Paul. 1. Cor. 3.19. And for Eccleſiaſtes, it rather deterreth from pleaſure, in that it argues all pleaſures of vanitie, and iudgeth them fooles who reſt vpon them: as on the contrarie, it maketh felicitie to conſiſt in the feare of God, and keeping his commandements, cap. 1.2. &amp; 7.3.8.12.11.9. and the whole twelfth Chapter. As for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6327:32"/> that of the ſoules immortalitie cap. 3.19. it is meant, not that Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſo thought, but that corrupt reaſon ſo iudgeth. As for the Song of ſongs, if it were meant of Pharaohs daughter, or ſome Sunamite damoſell, the compariſons, cited cap. 4.1.7.2. were monſtrous. And albeit the name of God is not mentioned in that booke, yet find we equiualent, and more fit names for that purpoſe: as <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Friend, Spouſe, Beloued,</hi> that it might appeare that the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spouſe of Salomon was here deſcribed, I meane the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 The errour of the Papiſts which is manifold: for they holde that the authoritie and certaintie of Scripture dependeth vpon the determination of the Church; that the Scripture is not authenticall but by the authoritie of the Church; and that it is not manifeſt that the Scriptures proceede from God, but by the teſtimonie of the Church: which error is moſt abſurd. For if truth be ſubiect to the pleaſure and iudgement of men, the conſciences are made doubtful of their ſaluation; and the ſame errour is confuted by the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 2.20. where the Apoſtle affirmeth, that the Church <hi>leaneth vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets:</hi> which foundation he cals not the very perſons of the Apoſtles, but their doctrine. For although the Church ſhould by her iudgement approue the ſcripture, yet doth ſhe not make of that, which is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and doubtfull, certaine and authentical, but doth by her iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſubſcribe to the truth of God, and doth embrace it as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from God.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, they account the Apocrypha bookes for Canonicall: They prattle that the Scripture is imperfect and obſcure, that the reading of the Scriptures is hurtful to the Church, that it is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of contention, that matters of controuerſie cannot be decided by Scripture alone, that it hath a noſe of waxe. They affirme that power to interprete and giue the ſenſe of Scriptures, belongs to the Biſhop of Rome. They match the writings of Fathers, Biſhops and Counſels with the Scripture. They take away from the common people the writings of their fathers laſt will and teſtament, and poſt them ouer to dumbe idols, as to lay-mens bookes, cleane contrary

Hereupon Paule Coloſ. 1.16. calleth them <hi>thrones, ſeates, dominations, principalities,</hi> which is an Hebrue kind of putting the Abſtract for the Concrete, the ſubſtantiue for the adiectiue, becauſe God vſeth their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the adminiſtration of Empires, kingdoms and commonweals.</p>
                  <p>But that there be Hierarchies, and degrees of Hierarchies among the Angels, as the Papiſts imagine, it cannot be proued by any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Scripture.

                  <p>It may be gathered from the words of Chriſt, that ordinarily euery elect child of God hath ſome one certaine good Angell appointed of God to keepe them.

                  </p>
                  <p>But extraordinarily it is cleare by the Scriptures, that as oft as need requireth, many Angels haue bene ſent to ſeuerall beleeuers to defend them. Pſal. 34.

                  <p>Concerning euill ſpirits we learne thus much, that ſometime one man is vexed by one and the ſelfe ſame euill ſpirit, as may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the hiſtorie of Iob, 1.12. And ſometime that many haue bene moleſted by one and the ſelfe ſame euill ſpirit, as in 2. Chron. 18.21. one euill ſpirit deceiued many Prophets. Alſo we reade that ſometime many euill ſpirits did moleſt one and the ſelfe ſame man, as Luke 8.30. a legion of diuels did poſſeſſe one man. But that God hath appointed to euery man one euill Angell, cannot be gathered out of any place of the Scripture.</p>

                  <p>Some of the Fathers were of opinion, that as one candle is lighted by another, euen ſo the whole man is deriued of the whole man, the ſoule of the ſoule, the bodie of the bodie.

                  <p>Againe, Adam ſaid of Euah, Geneſ. 2.23. <hi>This is now bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh:</hi> but he ſaith not, ſoule of my ſoule, which he ſhould haue ſaid: if ſo be that the ſoule of Euah had bene taken out of his ſoule.</p>

Pet. 4.19.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, that oppoſition doth ſeeme to require the ſame Heb. 12 9. where the fathers of our fleſh are oppoſed to the Father of ſpirits, becauſe he doth not vſe the helpe of men in creating of liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6327:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> to which we muſt referre that of Eſa. 57.16. where in expreſſe words God is ſaid to make ſoules, to wit, immediatly and not by propagation of man.</p>
                  <p>Yea the very nature of the ſoule doth teſtifie the ſame, which is moſt ſimple, and therefore indiuiſible.

                  <p>Neither by meanes of the ſoule, nor by meanes of the bodie, but by meanes of propagation from Adam alone. For that all mankind is corrupted by Adam, doth not ſo much proceed from generation, (vnleſſe it be in regard of the manner, that is, ſo farrefoorth as one ſinfull man begets another ſinfull man) as from the iuſt iudgement of God: who as he had adorned all men in one as the roote and head of all mankind with originall iuſtice: ſo after that Adam ſinned, in him did iuſtly ſpoile all of his gifts. Caluin Inſtit. lib. 2. cap. 1. Sect. 7. <hi>This contagion hath his cauſe neither in the ſubſtance of fleſh, nor of the ſoule: but becauſe it was ſo ordained of God, that thoſe gifts which he had beſtowed vpon the firſt man, he ſhould both haue them, and alſo looſe them, as well for himſelfe as for others that come after him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, the ſoules are infected in the bodies being corrupted with ſinne, not by phyſicall and naturall touching, (as wine put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſower veſſell) but by the moſt iuſt appointment of God. For ſo ſoone as the ſoule being pure in it ſelfe is vnited to the bodie which is conceiued in ſinne, that diſobedience of our firſt father is imputed vnto man as if it were his owne. Whereupon the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>all of vs ſinned in Adam</hi> as in the ſtocke, the meaning is, that all of vs were guiltie of ſinne, to wit, being in his loines, Rom. 5.12. After which maner alſo Leuie is ſaid to pay tithes to Abraham before he

                     <hi>was borne,</hi> Heb. 7.9.10. Now this diſobedience of Adam imputed, by the iuſt appointment of God, there followes preſently in the ſoule alſo contagion, or corruption, and an inclination to euill, as a puniſhment of that firſt ſinne, which puniſhment it ſelfe is alſo ſin: euen as the obedience of Chriſt imputed to vs is properly our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe whereby we are iuſtified: and regeneration is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of this righteouſneſſe. But as it is better to quench a fire, then aske how it begun, ſo is it better to quench originall ſin, then aske how it came.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer in actuall ſinne, the matter of the ſinne, remaineth not, for when a man hath either committed adulterie or ſpoken blaſpheamie, thoſe actions ſtraight ceaſe to be, when the thing is done, notwithſtanding the offence to God, and the guilt remaine ſtill. But in originall ſin, the matter therof paſſeth not away: for wee finde in experience that the corruption of nature ſticketh by vs: ſeeing ſtill we run into ſinne, and are vntoward to heauenly things both in body and ſoule,</p>

                  <p>By ſundry errors. 1. Of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who denie that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is deriued by propagation to poſteritie, but ſay it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed only by imitation and example.

                  <p n="2">2.

                     </gap> vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which is the tranſgreſsion of the whole law. Hence therefore I gather that the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is not any tranſgreſsion of the morall law, neyther vniuerſall nor particular, eyther of ignorance or infirmitie, or of malice committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3 Hence commeth to our conſideration <hi>Peters</hi> deniall of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who denied Chriſt, and that when his owne conſcience cried

From whence I conclude that the deniall of Chriſt proceeding from infirmitie, and not from a purpoſe to forſake Chriſt, but ſo that a man may finde out ſome way for his own ſafegard, is not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, although nothing commeth neerer it then this deniall.<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4 Let vs conſider that ſaying of our Lord, Mat, 12.31. and in the verſes following, where he obiecteth to the Phariſees blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt the holy Ghoſt, who not onely deſpiſed Chriſt and his Goſpell, but alſo ſaid that Chriſt caſt out diuels by Beelzabub the prince of the diuels, when as notwithha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they knew Chriſt by the Prophets, his owne doctrine and miracles, and were not ignorant that thoſe works of Chriſt were done by the power of the holy Ghoſt. Hence therefore I gather by the place, <hi>a concreto,</hi> that the matter or generall difference of ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt is, <hi>To denie Chriſt being knowne, and his holy Goſpell, and againſt a mans owne knowledge and conſcience to aſcribe to Sathan that worke which is proper to the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this is one manner, and one kinde of ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, which was the Phariſees ſinne. Such is theirs, who haue knowne the truth &amp; haue neuertheleſſe not ſubmitted themſelues to the truth, but reuile and ſlaunder the truth, calling it hereticall, erroneous, and diabolicall.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider we of that place. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.4. <hi>It is impoſsible that thoſe who haue beene once enlightened, (and after Catechiſing haue profeſſed Chriſtianitie, and by Baptiſme haue beene choſen and incorporated into the Church,) and haue taſted the heauenly gift, and haue beene partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and haue taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</hi> (but haue not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, much leſſe digeſted it,) if they fall away (namely, not into a particular ſinne againſt the firſt or ſecond table, but into an vniuerſall apoſtaſie, and reuolting from Chriſt) <hi>If they fall away they ſhould be renewed againe by repentance, ſeeing they crucifie againe

                  <p>Whence, 1. I gather that there is a ſecond kinde or manner of this ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Whereby a man vniuerſally and with full conſent reuolteth from Chriſt, being truely acknowledged and knowen both out of the Goſpell, and by the holy Ghoſt enlightening the heart: wherby alſo a man denieth Chriſt, and with all his ſtrength perſecuteth the truth of ſet malice, reproacheth and diſgraceth Chriſt, deſpiſing his ſacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 I gather that the ſubiect of this ſinne is not in all the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but in thoſe onely who haue acknowledged Chriſt and his truth.</p>

Such were many of the Iewes. Act. 6.10. who when they could not reſiſt <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the ſpirit of God, yet they laboured to reſiſt him. Yet there is no doubt but many of them were driuen to doe this

In the day of Pentecoſt receiued three thouſand men which repented, who had perſecuted Chriſt to the death. But it appeareth there were others who out of a malicious impiety did rage againſt God, that is, againſt the doctrine which they were not ignorant came from God.</p>
                  <p>Examples of the latter are <hi>Saule, Iudas, Arrius,</hi> alſo <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apollata, for this man was rightle trained vp in the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he knew the truth of the Goſpell, which alſo he publikely had profeſſed, hauing beene baptiſed: but afterwards by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of certaine wicked Philoſophers, <hi>Libanius, Iamblicus</hi> and others, he fell from Chriſt, became an enemie of Chriſt, and a perſecuter of the Church, he ſacrificed to the Idols of the Gentils, and with all his might endeuored to aboliſh Chriſts religion.</p>

                  <p>But the New Teſtament ſo farre forth as it is oppoſed to the law being conſidered by and in it ſelfe nakedly, hee calleth <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the miniſterie of the Spirit and righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, becauſe it reuealeth the mercie of God, by which wee are iuſtified, &amp; renewed by the ſpirit of Chriſt: whom the Goſpell hath, being ioyned vnto it, who alſo giueth to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that faith which he requireth of vs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, he calleth the Old teſtament, a teſtament of <hi>bondage,</hi> becauſe it breedeth a ſeruile feare in our mindes, becauſe the law, by adding a moſt hard and impoſſible condition, can ſtirre vp no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our heatts, but the feare of Gods wrath. But the new he calleth a Teſtament of <hi>Libertie,</hi> becauſe it ſtirreth vp the beleeuers to a ſonne-like truſt in God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Yee haue not receiued the Spirit of bondage again vnto feare, but the ſpirit of adoption, by vvhich vve crie, Abbafather.</hi>

Hence it is, that that is called generall faith, whereby wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that thoſe things which are reuealed vnto vs in the word of God are true, not by reaſon, but becauſe we are aſſured inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt, that they are deliuered and ſet out by God, who is true and almightie. By this faith we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the world was made by the word of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. of nothing. (Contrarie to the Axiome of all the Philoſophers, that of nothing nothing is made whereas otherwiſe, by the very teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of nature it might bee acknowledged, that the world was made) this faith, Iuſtifying faith doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe, and yet of it ſelfe it doth not iuſtifie. Of this faith the Lord ſpeaketh <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Heare mee .i. Beleeue mee, and your ſoule ſhall liue.</hi> And <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe things are vvritten that yee ſhould beleeue.</hi> And the word of God is not only the obiect whereat alone faith muſt aime, but it is alſo the <hi>Baſis</hi> and foundation whereby it is vnderpropped &amp; ſuſtained, from whence, if it doe neuer ſo little decline, it by and by fals to the ground. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Faith is by hearnig, &amp; hearing by the vvord of God,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence we gather, that nothing is to be accoumpted for the Doctrine of Faith &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is not deriued out of the word of God.</p>
                  <p>But the principall, chiefe immediate and proper obiect of faith, by the apprehenſion whereof it doth iuſtifie, is Chriſt crucified, with al his benefits, ſo farre forth as is offered vnto vs in the word and Sacraments, and in him God the father. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>By Chriſt his meanes you doe beleeue in God, which raiſed him from the dead, &amp; gaue him glorie that your faith and hope might bee in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>

                  <head>How many are the parts of this generall Repentance?</head>
                  <p>Three. 1 Contrition, whereby a man acknowledgeth his ſinne, and that he hath deſerued the iuſt wrath of God, and his curſe for ſinne, and doth earneſtly lament for the ſinne committed and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth the ſame: vnder which are comprehended <hi>Humilitie</hi> &amp; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie:</hi> ſuch as was in <hi>Peter,</hi> who being touched with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diuine power in Chriſt fell at his knees crying, <hi>Go from me Lord for I am a ſinfull man. Luk.</hi> 5.8. And in <hi>Dauid</hi> who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing daily to ſhed teares made account that he had need of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mercies. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.7. and 51.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Faith, which acknowledgeth Chriſt the mediator and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor with his father, and holdeth that ſinne is forgiuen for the mediators ſake, and that the righteouſneſſe of the mediator is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 New obedience, which conſiſteth of iuſt dealing toward our neighbour, holineſſe and puritie in the whole courſe of our liues, and diligence in performing the duties of our calling. Of which parts we haue an example, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37. In the woman that was a ſinner, whoſe teares were a witneſſe of her contrition. i. of her feare and griefe of conſcience according to God in regard of ſinne, her comming to Chriſt was a teſtimonie of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which ſhe had conceiued of him, and her obedience that ſhe yeeldes vnto Chriſt in waſhing his feete with her teares, wiping them with the haires of her head, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, did teſtifie her new obedience which is a fruit of faith.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>What thinke you of this Diuiſion?</head>
                  <p>I hold it to be true, but, to ſpeake properly, faith is no part of Repentance, but the mother, and fountaine thereof. For faith muſt needes ſhine before Repentance, and ſuch
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6327:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> faith, ſuch repentance. <hi>For no man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe, can repent, but hee that hopeth for pardon.</hi> And therefore, the cauſe of Repenting is drawne from the verie promiſe of ſaluation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Repent, for the kingdome of God is at hand,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay. Becauſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is at hand, therefore repent. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>With thee is mercie that thou maiſt be feared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, the Scripture doth not make mention of faith, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Repentance, that is to ſay, not as if repentance ſhould bee the <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>generall,</hi> and Faith the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>ſpeciall;</hi> but reckoneth them as two diuers things, <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith. Mark.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and beleeue the Goſpell. Luk.</hi> 24.47. <hi>Preach, in my name, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> And <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.21. ſaith. <hi>That hee had witneſſed both to Iewes and Graecians the repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Not that true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can ſtand without faith (for they are vnſeparable in the ſaints) but becauſe although they cannot bee ſeparated, yet they ought to be diſtinguiſhed, as hope and faith are, as in the ſinfull woman, the theefe, <hi>Dauid, Manaſſeh,</hi> and other repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>Finally new life or new obedience, to ſpeake properly, is not a part of repentance, but an effect and fruite thereof. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bring forth fruites worthy repentance.</hi> So Act. 26.20. <hi>Paule</hi> ſhewed vnto the Gentiles, <hi>That they ſhould repent and turne to God, and do workes worthy amendment of life,</hi> which are called the fruites and works of ſanctification.</p>

God could make all things of nothing, and man of the ſlime of the earth, why then can he not reſtore a dead man to life? <hi>Hee that made vs is as able to make vs againe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, why wonder wee? why doe wee not beleeue? it is God that doth this.

                  <p>Now the Analogie or proportion, which is the agreement, or conueniencie, of one thing hauing relation to another, is in the proportion or likeneſſe of the actions or effects, as for example, as water waſheth away filth: euen ſo the bloud of Chriſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away ſins.</p>
                  <p>The relation is in the inſtitution vnto the thing ſignified, or in the mutual reſpect of the one vnto the other, as when together with the ſigne exhibited to the ſenſes, the thing ſignified is repreſented to the vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, if wee reſpect the vſe, the forme of a Sacrament, is an action, wherein an earthly thing is lawfully and rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred and vſed for that end, whereunto it is appointed of God: or the manner of performing &amp; celebrating the Sacrament: for the forme of the Action, is the manner wherein it is done.</p>

                  <p>Truely there is: not in the nature or ſubſtance, the naturall qualitie, or quantitie of the Elements, the change, I ſay, is not of the eſſence &amp; nature, as ſaith <hi>Theodoret:</hi> But only in reſpect of the end, office, condition, &amp; vſe for which they bee propounded in the Church: namely, becauſe they begin to ſignifie to vs in trueth, things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together heauenly, and diuine, and that not of their owne nature, but by the appointment of the ſonne of God. As namely for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſake, when water, btead, &amp; wine are remoued from the common vſe, and by the commaundement of God are made the ſignes of the body and bloud of the Lord, which thing certainly they haue not by nature: For then euery water ſhould bee the ſigne of Chriſts bloud, but by the inſtitution of the Lord himſelf. Alſo the name of the ſignes are indeed changed, but not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely to the intent that we might haue a greater regard of the things ſignified then of the ſignes, and that the minde might mount vp from the Elements vnto Chriſt.

                  <p>No, becauſe it hath reſpect vnto the vſe only, and that publick too in the Church. Wherefore out of the verie action it ſelfe of the myſteries or the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, there is no place for it.

                  <head>Why did Christ appoint the Supper of the Lord in ſtead of the Sacrament of the Paſchall Lambe?</head>
                  <p>To ſhew that he had fulfilled thoſe things which were prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the ſhadow of the Iewiſh Paſſeouer. For in the olde Paſſeouer there was the bodie and bloud of the Paſcall Lambe being a beaſt: and in that feaſt was yearely iterated the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the preſeruation of the firſt borne of Iſrall by the bloud, and of their deliuerance out of Aegypt, as a prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thankfulneſſe, and a ſigne of their redemption which Chriſt ſhould worke: but in the new Teſtament the bodie of the true and onely <hi>Lambe of God,</hi> being ſlaine and offered vpon the Altar of the Croſſe, and his bloud ſhed for remiſsion of ſinnes, doth procure vnto vs farre more excellent things, then was the deliuerance out of Aegypt to the people of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>And the Supper of the Lord was inſtituted to this end, that by the receiuing of the bodie and bloud of the Lambe of God, there might bee made not a yearely onely, but a perpetuall communication, commemoration, and celebration of the moſt chiefe and eternall benefits, as of ſaluation purchaſed, and other more procured by the death of Chriſt: according to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.

And as the Paſchall Lambe was eaten with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes: ſo ought we alſo to receiue the Supper of the Lord with thankſgiuing. Laſtly, as it was a thing much to bee deſired to eate the Paſchall Lambe, ſo it is a ſweet thing to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers to eate the bread of the Lord.</p>

                  <head>Wherein do Sacrifices and Sacraments both agree and differ?</head>
                  <p n="1">1. They have this common to them both, that they are ordained of God, and had a Symbolicall ſignification: for the killing of a beaſt doth ſignifie, that the nature of man is become like the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beaſt through ſin<note n="q" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. They differ alſo in the end, or in the reſpect of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, &amp; of the thing giuen. For the purpoſe of the Sacrament is not that we ſhould offer any thing to God, but that ſomething be offered to vs, and that we ſhould receiue ſomthing from God: But the intent of a Sacrifice is that wee ſhould giue ſomething to God, or offer ſomething according to his owne appointment. Whereupon they are called oblations.</p>
                  <p>Further, there were two kinds in the manner of Sacrificing<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Now, although ſome of the legall Sacraments, were in their kinde alſo externall ſacrifices, as the Paſchall Lambe, which by name is termed an <hi>Oblation:</hi> Yet we may not iudge ſo of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Chriſtian Church, becauſe that only, &amp; that moſt perfect ſacrifice of Chriſt hath abrogated all externall Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces.</p>

                  <p>Againe, Sacraments differ from ſacrifices in the externall form or action: for certaine ſacrifices were burnt with fire, either who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that either vpon the Altar, as the <hi>holocaust or whole burnt offering,</hi> or without the campe, or citie<note n="e" place="margin">

                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14</note>.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe which were either eaten, or imprinted, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the bodie, they were Sacraments ſo properly called. Therefore an Altar was appointed to the Sacrifices: but not for the Sacraments which are eaten at a table. Whereupon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. ſaith, <hi>Ye cannot bee partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of the Diuels.</hi> Whereby it is apparant, that altars were vnknowne to thoſe antient Churches.

                  <p>Againe, Sacrifices were ſome propitiatorie, which were made, either for the high Prieſts ſin, or the whole peoples, or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. Otherſome were for thankſgiuing, as the ſacrifice of <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> or of health: whoſe kinds were gratulatorie, votarie, &amp; voluntarie.

                  <p>And ſuch phraſes are in indeede vſuall in the holy Scripture, and ſo be placed in the common vſe of the Church, and yet figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, which may be vnderſtood by the nature, conference of the words and things whereof the words ſpeake, or by the coherence of the parts.

                  <p>Now they are ſuch, becauſe the nature and eſſence of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, doth require the ſame, which commonly is defined to bee <hi>a viſible ſigne of ſacred things.</hi> And therefore if the words in the Sacraments be vnderſtood nakedly, without a trope, &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, they ſhall be no longer Sacraments, becauſe they ſhall bee no longer ſignes, but the things themſelues.

                  <p>This Rule is alſo perpetuall in the nature of things, that, <hi>in the affirmation of things that bee diuerſe one from another, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of one of them of another, the ſpeach muſt needes be euer tropicall or figuratiue, in any kinde of things, and neuer proper.</hi> For as oft as in any propoſition, the verbe Subſtantiue, <hi>eſt</hi> doth ioyne together things that bee diuerſe, which differ in their ſpeciall formes: then the affirmation is not proper, but figuratiue.

                  <p n="4">4 In the end common to them both.

                  <p n="5">5 In the effects: For as the word of life is to the godly the ſauour of life vnto life, to the vngodly the ſauour of death vnto death. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.

                  <p n="6">6 Laſtly, as the holy Ghoſt doth begin and ſtrengthen faith by the word: ſo alſo by the ſacraments he doth ſtirre vp, and confirme the ſame.

                  <head>Wherein do the word and Sacraments differ.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 In nature: Becauſe the word of the Goſpell doth in expreſſe words declare, to wit, that we by faith are made partakers of Chriſt Ieſus, and of all his merits: the ſacraments doe repreſent them by ſignes: or that doctrine which the word doth deliuer cleare and more manifeſt, the Sacraments doe propound the ſame in a myſterie, and not ſo expreſly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In the inſtruments. The word is deliuered with the mouth, &amp; receiued with the eares: but the rites of the ſacraments are adminiſtred with the hands: and they are ſubiect to the eyes, and the other ſenſes, and doe lead vs as it were vnto the thing preſent: as though wee ſhould nowe in ſome ſort touch Chriſt himſelfe with our handes, ſee him with our eyes, perceiue him with our taſte, and feele him with our whole heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In the ſubiect to whom. The promiſes of the word are generally, and in common pronounced to all alike, as well
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:6327:350"/> to the vnbeleeuers as to the beleeuers. For the word muſt be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched euen to the vnbeleeuers. But the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated ſeuerally to them which be probably known to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church: and they doe apply and reſtraine the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in a ſpeciall manner to euerie one that doth rightly vſe theſe rites: that, as certainely as thou doeſt vſe the viſible Ceremonie, according to Chriſt his inſtitution: So certainely thou mayeſt, and oughteſt to conclude, that Chriſt alſo and all his benefits do belong vnto thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In the meaſure of ſignifying: for the word doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally teach; but the ſpeciall office of the Sacraments is to ſeale: and further the word doth ſignifie, and apply ſpirituall things, but the Sacraments doe rather, and more eſpecially repreſent and applie.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In order: for whereas the Sacraments are the appendices of the word, which doe confirme faith, it is meet that in ſuch as bee of yeares, the preaching of the word ſhould goe before, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and to increaſe faith, together with a manifeſt profeſsion of faith, before they be rightly adminiſtred to any.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The word is auailable euen without the ſacraments, as may be ſeene in <hi>Cornelius</hi>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2 3.4.44.45</note>. But ſacraments without the word are of no force. For a ſeale without a Charter is nothing worth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The preaching of the word, and that effectuall, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in thoſe that be of yeares, that they may bee ſaued. For <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Rom. 10.17. Except it pleaſe GOD extraordinarily to worke in their hearts. But the Sacraments are not altogether expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor abſolutely ſo neceſſarie, that without exception, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer inioyes them not, ſhould therefore deſpaire of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope of ſaluation. For that ſaying of <hi>Bernard</hi> is moſt true: <hi>Not the want; but the contempt of the Sacraments is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 Laſtly, the word conſidered by it ſelfe alone, if it bee compared with the ſacrament conſidered by it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is better and more excellent then it. Although if the ſacrament bee added to it, it doth yet become more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and powerfull, and more effectuall for the confirmation
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:6327:351" rendition="simple:additions"/> of faith. Therefore we may not aſcribe the greater honour to the ſacraments then to the preaching of the goſpell, that is to ſay we may not attribute more to the ſeales, then to the written Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

For the eſſentiall forme being once taken away, the matter it ſelfe is alſo taken away. And therfore it is to bee thought that ſuch are not ſo much to be rebaptiſed, but as that indeede they ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be firſt conſecrated with true baptiſme, who being conuerted to the knowledge of the trueth, deſire to bee ingraffed into the Orthodoxall Church. And this agreeth with the decree of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> Councill.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt iudge otherwiſe of the baptiſme of ſome other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; as the <hi>Nouatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> who deliuered the true doctrine of the Trinitie: or of Papiſts (who are out of the way of truth in ſome part of doctrin, &amp; who poſſeſſe the place of paſtors, &amp; vſe the publick miniſterie, either by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon error, by long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, or by force, though they be not to bee accounted as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called.)

Secondly, in the confeſſion of that faith, into the which baptiſme leadeth, or in Catechiſticall queſtions, &amp; anſwers, or in ſtipulation, by which, thoſe that were to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in times paſt did teſtify their Inward baptiſme, being then to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed with the outward, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.31<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3.21</note>. But firſt &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the ſprinkling of water, in the name of the Father the ſonne and the Holy Ghoſt. And laſt of all in prayers, bleſſings &amp; giuing of thanks: in a language knowne vnto the people, that the congregation may be able to ſay, Amen. 1. Co. 14.16. for all theſe things are commaunded by Scripture, and example, as, <hi>Preach the Goſpell, hee that beleeueth, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 24.19. Act. 22.16, and, <hi>Bee thou baptized, and waſh away thy ſinnes, by calling on of the name of Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Scripture hath not preſcribed a ſet forme in certain words, concerning thoſe admonitions, and prayers, touching the inſtitution and Doctrine of baptiſme, which the word of God deliuereth: but hath left that free, as circumſtances may require for the better edifying of the Church, ſo that the foundation be kept.</p>

Truely, if there was nothing in the commaundement of God for circumciſing of Infants reprouable, neither can there bee any abſurditie noted in the baptizing of Infants.

                  <p>Fifthly, that gift of exorciſing ioyned with the gift of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was but for a time, as that alſo was when many ſicke people were healed by the annointing of the miniſters of the Church, and by inuocation of the name of Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Firſt they differ both in the ſignes, in the action, and in their neereſt ends. For in Baptiſme, water is vſed, and the ſpinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof outwardly, and the inward ſprinckling of the bloud of Chriſt inwardly. Alſo the neereſt &amp; principall end therof is the waſhing from ſin, ct adoption, to be the ſons of God, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting into Chriſt, &amp; into his Church: but in the Supper is vſed <hi>bread,</hi> which we break, &amp; eat, &amp; inwardly there is a pertaking of the body of Chriſt: likewiſe there is a cup vſed out of which wee
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:6327:373" rendition="simple:additions"/> drinke, and alſo a communion of the bloud of Chriſt: laſtly, the end of the Lords ſupper is the ſpirituall foode of the inner man: &amp; this is a manifeſt differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between Baptiſme &amp; the Lords Svpper.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they differ in vſe, for Baptiſme is not to bee iterated, whereas the often and religious vſe of the Lords Supper ought to ſerue for a Commemoration of the Lords death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they differ in ſubiect, for Baptiſme properly belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to children, though the vſe thereof pertaine properly to thoſe of age, whereas the Lords ſupper doth only belong to them that are of yeares.</p>
                  <p>But in theſe things they both agree, they haue both one <hi>genus,</hi> both one <hi>Author,</hi> both conſiſt of <hi>two parts,</hi> the one earthly, the other heauenly, both one generall end, both one ſignification, for both doe ſignifie the Communion of Chriſt, both are ſeales of the Couenant, and of the promiſe of grace, the dignitie of both is equall and alike, for of baptiſme <hi>Paule</hi> teſtifieth, that we are ingrafted into Chriſt, and doe put on Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <head>Is not one of theſe Sacraments better, and more worthy than the other?</head>
                  <p>No not in being, that is, not becauſe in baptiſme we receiue only the gifts or graces of Chriſt, but not Chriſt himſelfe: but in the Supper the body and bloud of Chriſt, although al doe not receiue his graces (as our aduerſaries wil haue it): becauſe they haue both one end, to wit, our conſociation and coniunction with Chriſt, which as the forme alſo of both, is ſealed both in Baptiſme, &amp; the Lords Supper. But they differ onely in ſome reſpect both of our originall beginning in Chriſt, and alſo of our encreaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation in the ſame. For by how much it is ſomewhat more to be begotten then to be nouriſhed, by ſo much the Sacrament of regeneration is to be preferred, before the Sacrament of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which is the Lords Supper: but by how much it is a more excellent thing to bee nouriſhed and cheriſhed to eternall life, that ſo thou maieſt neuer faile to bee a man regenerate, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Supper is to be preferred before baptiſme. But ſeeing that the dignitie of both of them dependeth vpon the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, namely, vpon our Communion with Chriſt, although
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:6327:374" rendition="simple:additions"/> Baptiſme doth commend the ſame vnder the forme of a Lauer, and the Supper vnder the forme of food, yet it is better to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this compariſon and ſo ſhall nothing bee derogated from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. For the water of Baptiſme in the Sacramentall vſe is the bloud of Chriſt no leſſe than the wine in the Super,<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 2</note> nor is it any thing leſſe in Baptiſme to bee ingrafted into Chriſt, to be crucified, dead, buried, and riſe againe with him, and to put on Chriſt: than to eate his fleſh and drinke his bloud in the Supper. And to conclude Chriſt is propounded vnto vs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme as a bath, as an entrance into the houſe of the Lord, and as a garment. And in the Supper as meat and drinke to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more and more by faith.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, it is a document of mortification, and renewing of our nature, which Chriſt witneſſeth that he both doth, and will effect in vs by his ſpirit, which though it be imperfect in this life, yet it effecteth ſo much, that though ſin dwell, yet it raigneth not in vs, but rather is daily mortified more and more by the grace of the ſame ſpirit<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, it is the badge of our vnion and ſocietie with Chriſt, that we may knowe that we are conioyned vnto him, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the head, and therefore that we are now made pertakers of his goods, and ſhall at the length be made partakers of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe together with his inheritance. 1.

                  <p>It is the other Euangelical Sacrament in the Chriſtian Church, ordained of Chriſt (being euen now about to die) for them which are full growne, being alreadie baptized, and examining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, wherein, by outward breaking of bread and powring out of wine into the cup, is repreſented, and as it were, is ſet before the eyes of the faithfull, the crucifying of the bodie, and ſhedding of the bloud of Chriſt for vs: and by giuing, taking and vſing of thoſe Elements, the forgiueneſſe of our ſins gotten by the death of Chriſt, the inward raking and ſpirituall enioying of his bodie &amp; bloud, &amp; moreouer communion with Chriſt, &amp; ful nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Chriſt &amp; viuification, and fellowſhip together with the reſt of his liuely members is ſignified, confirmed, &amp; ſealed to the faithful: &amp; the memorie of ſo great benefits, &amp; giuing of thanks is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the commendable vſe of the faithfull, aſſembled together that they may increaſe in faith and loue.</p>
                  <p>For as by baptiſme we are borne againe, ſo (being borne again) wee are fed and nouriſhed by the Supper of the Lord, and in Chriſt wee are as it were nouriſhed and brought vp to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Therfore when as Baptiſme may once onely be adminiſtred, the Supper of the Lord is to be vſed often, becauſe in it Chriſt is giuen vnto vs after the manner of meate: but becauſe meat and drinke doe goe away into nouriſhment, they are often in our life time to be taken of vs.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the firſt example, or patterne of that definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the hiſtorie of the firſt Supper of the Lord expounded by <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the reſt of the Euangeliſts. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26 <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>What manner therefore of predication is it?</head>
                  <p>Not proper and regular: for that propoſition is not identicall (wherin the ſame thing is ſaid of it ſelfe, as, <hi>This is bread,</hi> of bread, <hi>This is a bodie,</hi> of a bodie) ſeeing that breade and the bodie of Chriſt doe differ in kinde: neither is the ſpeciall ſpoken of the ſingular, nor the generall, the difference, the proper, or the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, of the ſpeciall, as <hi>Peter</hi> is a man, a man is a liuing creature, apt to be taught, white: but an vnlike thing of an vnlike, the thing ſignified, of the ſigne, yet notwithſtanding propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, as the manner of relatiues doth require: for things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, or vnlike, if there bee an Analogie or ſignification, may ſo be conioyned, that they may make a propoſition, but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, as <hi>I am the vine, Iohn.</hi> 15.1. and the <hi>field is the word.</hi> 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this predication is figuratiue, and that not ſimplie Metaphoricall, or allegoricall, (like as, the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt are called the meat and drinke of the faithfull) but Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimicall. For, moſt rightly it is called a Metonimie not of the continent for the conteined, but of that manner, whereby the name of the thing ſignified, is giuen to the ſigne. As in this propoſition, <hi>The bread is the bodie of Christ,</hi> the name of the thing ſignified, which is the bodie of Chriſt, is giuen to the ſigne, namely bread.

                  <p>For it is a fooliſh thing to ſay that Sacramentall predications are vnuſuall, whereof there is ſo frequent vſe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>And truely this figuratiue predication is, not in euery word ſeuerally, and conſidered in it ſelfe: but in the whole attribution: for bread is bread properly: and the bodie not allegoricall, not tropicall, not figuratiue, much leſſe a ſpirit, or viſion: alſo not a myſticall bodie, which is the Church, or a ſigne of the bodie: it ſignifieth not the merit of Chriſt; but the proper body of Chriſt: for the true body of the Lord is altogether ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the true bread, I ſay, it is in the whole attribution, becauſe the <hi>copula</hi> or word <hi>est is,</hi> doth ioyne together two things vnlike: which wee may reſolue thus, Bread is the ſigne or ſeale of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But againe, it is to bee noted, that it is not onely a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, Metonimicall, or ſignificatiue ſpeech, as this is, <hi>The field is the world,</hi> that is, ſignifieth the word, and other like in parables (becauſe ſo it ſhould more faintly expreſſe the nature of that myſterie) but Sacramental: becauſe therwithal the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing ſealed is promiſed, as in this propoſition; Rods bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together, are the Romane Empire, that is, they do not barely nor ſimply onely ſignifie the Iuriſdiction of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but they doe certainely teſtifie that the Empire together with the ſignes is tranſferred to him to whom the rods are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deliuered.

We haue no ſuch doctrine, neither haue the Churches of God. As for the truth of this in practiſe, looke we but to the daies of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> when more ſuffered for religion in 5. years, then haue done for treaſon in 45. ſince: did any the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebel againſt the life of that Queen? did they not ſuffer the loſſe of goods, liberty, coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try, lands, and life, &amp; praied rather that their ſoueraigns eies might be opened, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her years diminiſhed?

As for this auctor, becauſe the auctor of the <hi>proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Apology for Catholicks,</hi> may bring him in an enemy to magiſtracy, I wiſh in ſome points he had written more ſparingly: He ſaith if a gouernour come vpon a ſubiect to ſpoyle him, and kill him, by the law of nature, he may defend himſelfe. We ſay with <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> it is better to be killed then to kill: and to anſwer them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and offence are not a like. He ſaith, <hi>Dauid</hi> might haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saule:</hi> we lay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> God forbid I ſhould lay hands v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lords annointed: and <hi>Dauid</hi> being annointed king, had another gates warrant than they can ſhew. He ſaith, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and notorious tyrannie ſubiects may craue aide from forrain Princes, we ſay, Bleſſed are they that ſuffer: And bleſſed be God, our gouernors are ſuch as we need not to ſeeke aid againſt them.

He ſaith, that the Iewes did well to riſe againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> we ſay the fact was extraordinary. In a word, there is nothing in him, nor I hope in any Proteſtant writer, which will warrant conſpiracies againſt Princes: which doctrine was deuiſed by the diuell, nourced by the Pope, learned in Seminaries, practiſed more of late by Ieſuites, then euer it was before, &amp; written, as <hi>Dracoes</hi> lawes, by the fauor of God, in their own bloud.
